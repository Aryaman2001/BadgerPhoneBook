# About the app

Developed an Java application in a team of four for CS 400 group project that stores contact information in a red black tree with name as key. App;ication comes preloaded with some course staff contact. Users can add, edit, lookup contacts and display all contacts.

# What I learned

I learned to implement a red black tree from scratch. I worked as a data wrangler and gained experience in implementing container classes to store a contact.

# Preview of the application

Users interact with the application from console.
